1. Homepage CTA completely broken
What's happening: Users click "Start Creating" / "Generate Receipt" and NOTHING happens. They rage-click 3-4 times, get frustrated, then leave or go to your blog instead.

Why it's killing you: This is your #1 entry point. If this doesn't work, zero conversions are possible.

Fix:

Debug click handler – it's either not attached or being blocked
Check for z-index overlays blocking the button
Check JavaScript console for errors
Add loading state immediately on click
Test on all browsers/devices
Expected impact: +300% conversion (most users can't even enter the funnel)

2. Generator page = instant bounce
What's happening: Users finally reach /generate-advanced but 60%+ leave within 7-15 seconds without touching ANYTHING. They just look and leave.

Why it's killing you: Your generator looks empty, confusing, or scary. Users don't understand what to do.

Fix:

Pre-fill ALL fields with realistic example data
Add a 3-second auto-playing GIF showing the process
Add text at top: "Create your receipt in 3 easy steps: Fill → Preview → Download (2 minutes)"
Add floating "?" help button that stays visible
Consider a welcome modal on first visit: "Here's how this works..."
Expected impact: +200% (stop the instant bounces)

3. Form controls don't respond
What's happening: Users try to:

Click "Add Section" → nothing
Type in textareas → nothing
Click item delete (×) → nothing
Upload logo → nothing
Select payment method → nothing
They rage-click everything, get frustrated, then abandon.

Why it's killing you: Even committed users who get past the generator page can't actually USE it.

Fix:

Debug ALL form event handlers
Add visual feedback to EVERY interaction:
Button clicks: show ripple effect
Text input: highlight border
Item added: flash green
Item deleted: fade out animation
Add error messages if validation blocks something
Test every single button/input on the page
Expected impact: +150% (users can finally complete their task)

4. Download button = black hole
What's happening: Users fill out everything, click "Download" or "Create Receipt" and:

Nothing visible happens
They don't know if it worked
They click 2-3 more times rapidly
They abandon, unsure if they got the file
Why it's killing you: This is the FINAL conversion step. You're losing people at the goal line.

Fix:

onClick = async () => {
  // 1. Immediate feedback
  setButtonText('Generating...')
  showLoadingSpinner()
  
  // 2. Do the action
  const result = await generateReceipt()
  
  // 3. Success feedback
  if (result.success) {
    showToast('✓ Receipt downloaded! Check your downloads folder.')
    confetti() // Optional but effective
    setButtonText('Download Again')
  } else {
    showToast('✗ Error: ' + result.error)
  }
}
Add:

Loading spinner on button
Success toast notification (big, green, stays 5 seconds)
Change button text to "✓ Downloaded! Download again?"
Confetti animation (seriously – it works)
Expected impact: +50% (clear success = trust = return users)

🔥 HIGH-PRIORITY FIXES (Fixing these = 3x conversion)
5. Pricing page = instant bounce
What's happening: Users click "Remove Watermark" → land on pricing page → leave in < 5 seconds. 95%+ bounce rate on pricing.

Why it's killing you: This is your revenue. You're not just losing free users – you're losing PAYING customers who showed purchase intent.

Fix:

Option A (recommended): Don't navigate away

// Show pricing as modal overlay
<Modal>
  <h2>Remove watermark for $2.99</h2>
  <div>
    <img src="receipt_with_watermark" />
    <span>→</span>
    <img src="receipt_without_watermark" />
  </div>
  <button>Upgrade Now</button>
  <button>Continue with watermark</button>
</Modal>
Option B: Fix pricing page

Load instantly (< 1 second)
Show their receipt preview at top
Clear before/after comparison
Add "Go back to editing" button prominently
Consider lower price ($1.99 or pay-what-you-want)
Expected impact: +400% on paid conversions

6. Long editing sessions end in nothing
What's happening: Users spend 5-20 minutes carefully filling out receipts, adding items, adjusting details... then just leave without downloading. Zero payoff for their effort.

Why it's killing you: These are your MOST engaged users. They're doing the work but not completing. Something is blocking them at the end.

Fix:

Make "Download" button sticky (always visible at bottom)
Add progress indicator: "7/10 fields complete"
Add auto-save with notification: "Draft saved"
Add exit-intent popup: "Wait! Download your receipt before leaving"
Debug the actual download function – it might be silently failing
Expected impact: +200% (convert engaged users)

7. Reset button = progress destroyer
What's happening: Users accidentally click "Reset" after 10-20 minutes of work. Everything disappears. They immediately quit in frustration.

Why it's killing you: You're destroying user trust and wasting their time.

Fix:

onResetClick = () => {
  const confirmed = window.confirm(
    '⚠️ Are you sure?\n\nThis will permanently delete all your work.\n\nThis cannot be undone.'
  )
  if (!confirmed) return
  
  // Better: add undo
  const backup = {...formData}
  clearForm()
  showToast('Receipt cleared. Undo?', {
    action: () => restoreForm(backup),
    duration: 10000
  })
}
Also:

Move Reset to bottom, make it small and red
Change text to "⚠️ Delete Everything"
Consider removing it entirely (who needs it?)
Expected impact: +30% (stop destroying user effort)

🔧 MEDIUM FIXES (Fixing these = 2x conversion)
8. Template browsing leads nowhere
What's happening: Users browse templates, filter by category, click on templates... but never generate receipts. They browse and leave.

Why it's killing you: Templates should be your highest-converting path (intent is clear) but it's a dead end.

Fix:

Make template cards bigger and more clickable
Add prominent "Use This Template" button on each card
On click → auto-navigate to generator with template pre-loaded
Add preview modal on hover
Track which templates get clicked most (optimize for those)
Expected impact: +150%

9. Template selection = rage clicks
What's happening: Users click on template cards and nothing happens. They rage-click then leave.

Why it's killing you: Another broken click handler killing conversion.

Fix:

Debug template card click handlers
Add hover state (scale up 5%, add shadow)
Add click state (scale down 2%)
Add loading state after click
Make entire card clickable, not just button
Expected impact: +100%

10. No session recovery
What's happening: Users start a receipt, navigate away (pricing, templates, blog), come back and their work is gone. They start over or quit.

Why it's killing you: You're making users do double work.

Fix:

// Save to localStorage every 10 seconds
useInterval(() => {
  localStorage.setItem('receipt_draft', JSON.stringify(formData))
}, 10000)

// On page load
useEffect(() => {
  const draft = localStorage.getItem('receipt_draft')
  if (draft && isRecent(draft)) {
    showModal({
      title: 'Continue where you left off?',
      body: 'We found your unfinished receipt from 5 minutes ago.',
      actions: [
        { text: 'Continue', onClick: () => loadDraft(draft) },
        { text: 'Start Fresh', onClick: () => clearDraft() }
      ]
    })
  }
}, [])
Expected impact: +80%

11. Form fields are laggy
What's happening: Users type in fields or click buttons and there's a visible delay. Leads to rage-clicks and frustration.

Why it's killing you: Feels broken even if it technically works.

Fix:

Debounce onChange handlers (wait for user to stop typing)
Use optimistic UI updates (show change immediately)
Profile React renders (use React DevTools)
Memoize expensive computations
Lazy load non-critical components
Expected impact: +50%

12. Logo upload doesn't work
What's happening: Users rage-click the logo upload field repeatedly. Nothing happens or it's unclear if it worked.

Why it's killing you: Users want to customize. If they can't, the product feels broken.

Fix:

Add clear "Click to upload logo" placeholder image
Show loading spinner during upload
Show preview immediately after upload
Add "Remove" button next to uploaded logo
Show error if file is too big/wrong format
Support drag-and-drop
Expected impact: +40%

📊 TRACKING & MONITORING FIXES
13. Add conversion funnel tracking
// Track the entire funnel
posthog.capture('homepage_viewed')
posthog.capture('cta_clicked')
posthog.capture('generator_loaded')
posthog.capture('first_field_edited')
posthog.capture('preview_clicked')
posthog.capture('download_clicked')
posthog.capture('download_succeeded')

// Track friction points
posthog.capture('rageclick_detected', { element: 'add_section_button' })
posthog.capture('form_abandoned', { time_spent: 324, fields_filled: 7 })
posthog.capture('pricing_bounced', { time_on_page: 3 })
14. Add error tracking
// Catch all errors
window.onerror = (msg, url, line) => {
  posthog.capture('javascript_error', { msg, url, line })
}

// Track API failures
fetch('/api/generate').catch(err => {
  posthog.capture('api_failed', { 
    endpoint: '/api/generate',
    error: err.message 
  })
})
15. Add performance monitoring
// Track slow operations
const start = Date.now()
await generateReceipt()
const duration = Date.now() - start

if (duration > 3000) {
  posthog.capture('slow_operation', {
    operation: 'generate_receipt',
    duration_ms: duration
  })
}

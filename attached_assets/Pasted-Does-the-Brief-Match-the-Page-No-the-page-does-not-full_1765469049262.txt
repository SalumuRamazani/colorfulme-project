Does the Brief Match the Page?
No, the page does not fully match the brief. Some parts are the same as the old version. Others have the changes. I checked each one.

The page has many old headers with big letters. Body text is not changed much. FAQs are missing new ones. Only small parts like "100+ Templates Available" seem new, but not from the brief.
